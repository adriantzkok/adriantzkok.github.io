export const MOTTO1 = `Coming from a non-traditional background venturing into the world of AI & Data, I've built my career and skills through self-directed learning and genuine curiosity. I believe that hard work and a willingness to learn can help you master skills others might find daunting. This principle extends beyond technology; I've also learned Japanese and Chinese from zero to support my goal of building a career across Asia. I hope that my journey is a testament to my dedication and reflects my commitment to continuous learning and adapting to new challenges.`;
